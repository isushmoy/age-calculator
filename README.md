### Lessons Learned

- **Efficient Age Calculation**: I improved my understanding of the JavaScript logic required for effective age calculation without cluttering the codebase. Implementing a streamlined calculation process was crucial for ensuring accuracy and performance.

- **Integration of CSS and Bootstrap**: I successfully integrated CSS and Bootstrap to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of the application. This involved leveraging Bootstrap components and utilities while customizing styles to fit the project's requirements.

- **Vue.js Customization**: I learned to adapt Vue.js to suit the specific needs of the project. Utilizing Vue.js directives such as v-model, @click, @keyup, v-if, and :class enabled me to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently.

- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Implementing dynamic light/dark mode support enhanced the accessibility and user experience of the application. I gained experience in dynamically changing the theme based on the user's system-wide color scheme preference, improving readability in various lighting conditions.

- **Animation Implementation**: Adding animations to elements using keyframes enriched the user interaction and engagement within the application. By incorporating subtle animations, I enhanced the visual appeal and provided users with intuitive feedback during interactions.
